# TTR
Code for the paper "Low rank tensor train coefficent array estimation for tensor-on-tensor regression"

## Requirements

The algorithms have been implemented in MATLAB and make extensive use of:

MATLAB Tensor Toolbox 2.6 (http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/)

TT-Toolbox (TT=Tensor Train) Version 2.2 (http://spring.inm.ras.ru/osel)


## Contents
The main algorithms are in /tools. 

The demo folder contains files for reproducing the synthetic experiments from the paper.
